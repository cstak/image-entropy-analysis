#Entropy (Shannon Entropy) of a Plane and Encrypted Image
Information entropy analysis is one of the important analyzes used in security analysis of encryption methods. With this analysis, the amount of information can be measured and it can be monitored whether the information has been removed or not. It tests how successful an encryption method is in distributing and removing data that creates meaningful information.

This is a simple console application for calculating entropy of an image. You can play with the codes as you want.
